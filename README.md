DEVELOPMENT:
Copy pasting the hangman code from last time was pretty painless, just had to adapt it into a method. I had to keep the while loop in the main game code even if it doesn't loop because of the structure. I could have possibly remade it without but it seemed like alot of unnecessery work. 
There were alot of weird bugs that popped up when working with the results screens, the cause was just trying to send an int as a String.
but the really weird thing was that there were no errors, the app just instantly restarts. made the whole thing a pain in the ass to figure out.
